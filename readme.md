SMITE is a toolbox for using eye trackers from SMI GmbH with MATLAB,
specifically offering integration with [PsychToolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/). A Python version
that integrates with PsychoPy is also available from
www.github.com/marcus-nystrom/SMITE. For a similar toolbox for Tobii eye trackers, please see www.github.com/dcnieho/Titta.

`demos/readme.m` shows a minimal example of using the toolbox's
functionality.

To run the toolbox, it is required to install the SMI iViewX SDK version
4.4.26. An up-to-date version of PsychToolbox is recommended. Make sure
PsychToolbox's GStreamer dependency is installed.

Tested on MATLAB R2015b & R2018a. Octave is currently not supported.

## Usage
As demonstrated in the demo scripts, the toolbox is configured through
the following interface:
1. Retrieve (default) settings for eye tracker of interest: `settings =
SMITE.getDefaults('trackerName');` Supported tracker model names are `HiSpeed`,
`RED`, `RED-m`, `RED250mobile`, `REDn Scientific`, and `REDn
Professional`.
2. Change settings from their defaults if wanted (see [supported options](#supported-options) section below)
3. Create a SMITE instance using this settings struct: `EThndl = SMITE(settings);`

### API
#### Static methods
The below method can be called on a SMITE instance or on the SMITE class directly.

|Call|inputs|outputs|description|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|`getDefaults`|<ol><li>`tracker`: one of the supported eye tracker model names</li></ol>|<ol><li>`settings`: struct with all supported settings for a specific model of eyeTracker</li></ol>|Gets all supported settings with defaulted values for the indicated eyeTracker, can be modified and used for constructing an instance of SMITE. See the [supported options](#supported-options) section below.|

#### Construction
An instance of SMITE is constructed by calling `SMITE()` with either the name of a specific supported eye tracker model (in which case default settings for this model will be used) or with a settings struct retrieved from `SMITE.getDefaults()`, possibly with changed settings (passing the settings struct unchanged is equivalent to using the eye tracker model name as input argument).

#### Methods
The following method calls are available on a SMITE instance
